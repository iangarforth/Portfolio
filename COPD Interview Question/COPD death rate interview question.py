Ideally, the crude death rate should simply be the national total of the 2019 COPD deaths for each country, divided by the 2019 population.  Unfortunately, the total COPD deaths is not available, so instead I have calculated it from the actual population in each age group (from World Population Prospects), and used the COPD death rate for this age group to
estimate a figure for deaths for each group.  By adding these across all age groups, this is as close as we can get to total COPD deaths for the population.

It is also worth noting that I have grouped the age groups above 85 into one group in the crude measure, to fit with the WHO population proportions.

This calculation for Crude Death Rate gives a figure of 57.2 deaths per 100k people in the USA, and 5.8 deaths per 100k people in Uganda.  At first, this difference is staggering - almost 900% greater.  However, the issue is the population structure of both countries.  The USA population pyramid indicates there are proportionally far more older people than in Uganda, and COPD is far more prevalent in older age groups.

In calculating the Age-standardised Death Rate (by the direct method) by using the WHO standard population proportions, these population differences are controlled against, and in this measure, the COPD standardised death rates for both countries are remarkably similar - 28.4 for the USA, and 28.7 for Uganda.

In its own way, this is just as striking: there is a known correlation between COPD and smoking, and a known correlation between smoking and lower-income groups.  Accordingly, one might expect the age-standardised rate for Uganda to diverge more widely from the USA, but it does not.  Clearly, there is more to explore here.
