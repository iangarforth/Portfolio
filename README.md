## Portfolio

Thanks for taking the time to look.  This repo is a collection of various bits of work that I'm currently working on, that I'm particularly proud of, or that summarise the way I do things.

Current contents:
| Project | Explanation |
|-------  | -----------|
| COPD | This considers the rates of Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease between the US and Uganda.  Considered on crude death rates, there is a marked difference, but the task is a wonderful example of wehy it's important to consider epidemiogical issues like this through the lens of a standard population. |
| GDS_the_RPG | This is a light-hearted text-based adventure game.  In particular, each scene is stored as a row in a CSV file, which is perhaps a less common way or organising it.|
| Hurricane Analysis |  |
| US Medical Insurance | This is a consideration of a dataset that details medical insurance costs in the US. I'm interested to explore differences in the data and correlation with other factors, but in particular, the differences between the charges that men and women pay, and what might be the reasons, or at least factors that affect this. |
